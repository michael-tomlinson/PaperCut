/*
* Bypass account selection popups when using Google Cloud Print or Email to Print
*
* This recipe allows users to bypass account selection and have jobs automatically 
* charged to their personal accounts when using Google Cloud Print or Email to Print. 
* This is useful in cases when the user would be unable to select a shared account due 
* to them not having access to the user client (e.g. sending a print job from a 
* mobile device).
* 
* Note: this will charge the job to the personal account, even if the user is set with 
* 'Allow user to charge to their personal account' unchecked. Alternatively, if GCP users
* are required to select an account, they should instead use the Mobile Client (see the Mobile
* Client section of the manual for more information).
